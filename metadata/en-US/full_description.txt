Solar is an app to monitor off grid solar setups over bluetooth.

It supports simultaneous monitoring of the battery and solar charger. When both devices are connected it can calculate the inverter power. 

Unlike the OEM app it does not require fine location access and does not have internet permission.

Currently only the Junctek KH-F battery monitor (KH110F/KH140F/KH160F) and Ruijing 60A MPPT solar charger (sold under various brands like LiTime, HQST, etc.) are supported.

Features:
- Real time voltage, current, power, and energy readings
- Live plotting of power readings of the charger, battery, and inverter
- Reading history from the solar charger
